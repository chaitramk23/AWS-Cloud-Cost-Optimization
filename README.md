# AWS-Cloud-Cost-Optimization
AWS cloud cost optimization often starts with identifying and managing stale or unused resources. These resources can accumulate quickly and increase costs unnecessarily. Hereâ€™s how you can identify and handle stale resources effectively:
# Identifying Stale EBS Snapshots
In this example, we'll create a Lambda function that identifies EBS snapshots that are no longer associated with any active EC2 instance and deletes them to save on storage costs.
# Description:
The Lambda function fetches all EBS snapshots owned by the same account ('self') and also retrieves a list of active EC2 instances (running and stopped). For each snapshot, it checks if the associated volume (if exists) is not associated with any active instance. If it finds a stale snapshot, it deletes it, effectively optimizing storage costs.
